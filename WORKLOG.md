# 📝 Work Log - Smart Locker System

## 🗓️ Week 1: February 17 - February 23, 2025
### February 17
- Set up **MakiByte LLC** GitHub organization and transferred repository ownership.
- Initialized repository structure for **SmartLockerSystem**.
- Started implementing **LockerSystem** class for efficient package storage.
- **LeetCode:** Solved *Generate Parentheses* to improve recursive thinking, which later helped in designing backtracking logic for locker allocation.

### February 18
- Designed **locker allocation algorithm** using `TreeSet` for optimized searches.
- Implemented **package storage logic**, ensuring lockers are assigned efficiently.
- **LeetCode:** Practiced *DI String Match, Clumsy Factorial* to refine sorting and greedy strategies, which contributed to designing a better locker search mechanism.

### February 19
- Added **package retrieval functionality**, allowing users to retrieve stored items.
- Optimized **locker search** by implementing a **binary search approach**.
- **LeetCode:** Solved *Can Make Palindrome from Substring*, which helped in thinking about **efficient substring lookups**—a concept that may later be useful if we implement locker name searching.

### February 20
- Refactored **LockerSystem** class to improve maintainability.
- Enhanced **error handling**, preventing invalid operations.
- **LeetCode:** Practiced *Happy Strings of Length n*, reinforcing combinatorial logic, which later inspired a possible **locker name generation mechanism**.

### February 21
- Implemented **command-line interface (CLI)** for user interaction.
- Allowed users to **store, retrieve, and check locker status**.
- **LeetCode:** Solved *Basic Calculator II, Dota2 Senate*, which helped in handling **expression parsing**, an idea that could be useful if adding complex user queries for searching lockers.

### February 22
- Conducted **unit testing** for `LockerSystem` functionalities.
- **LeetCode:** Solved *Find Unique Binary String, Replace Words*, reinforcing **efficient search and Trie-based word replacement**, which might be applicable in locker keyword tagging in the future.

### February 23
- Fixed **locker overflow issue**, preventing incorrect package allocations.
- Benchmarked **storage and retrieval speed**.
- **LeetCode:** Practiced *Design Add and Search Words Data Structure, Longest Common Prefix*, learning Trie-based searching, which could be useful for predictive locker search.

## 🗓️ Week 2: February 24 - February 28, 2025
### February 24
- **Integrated Trie Data Structure** into `LockerSystem` for optimized lookups.
- **LeetCode:** Solved *Implement Trie (Prefix Tree), Search Suggestions System*, directly applying Trie-based searching for efficient **locker keyword matching**.

### February 25
- Improved **locker management efficiency**, reducing **time complexity** for retrieval.
- **LeetCode:** Studied *Design Most Recently Used Queue, Remove Sub-Folders from Filesystem*, which helped in designing a **cache system for frequently accessed lockers**.

### February 26
- Added **fault tolerance features** (e.g., handling **locker resets**).
- **LeetCode:** Practiced *Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree, Short Encoding of Words*, focusing on **data recovery**, which may be applicable for handling system crashes.

### February 27
- Researched **dynamic programming approaches** to enhance storage optimization.
- **LeetCode:** Solved *Word Break, Word Break II, Implement Magic Dictionary*, learning **efficient word segmentation**, which might be used for **locker category searches**.

### February 28
- **Finalized first version of SmartLockerSystem**.
- Documented **Locker System API**, preparing for potential web-based extension.
- **LeetCode:** Studied *Last Stone Weight, Merge Nodes in Between Zeros, Split Linked List in Parts*, reinforcing **linked list manipulations**, which could be useful if implementing **locker chaining** in the future.
